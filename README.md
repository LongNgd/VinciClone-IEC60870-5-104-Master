Vinci Clone - IEC 60870-5-104 - Master
--------------------------------------
This app was made in September, 2022, when I was doing my internship.
I cloned a part of the Vinci.exe (Master device), which used IEC 60870-5-104 protocol to read and display statistics from the specialized equipment in the electricity industry.
Features:
- Connect/disconnect to slave using TCP/IP
- Display device's statistics (ASDU type 1,13,30)
